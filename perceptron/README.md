# Simple perceptron network generator

This project is our own implementation of a fully connected perceptron neural network.

There are visualisations included that can help you understand the structure of your nn, as well as examples of training/testing data located in subdir `projekt1`. 

The project was implemented for Neural Networks class at Warsaw University of Technology. We do understand the quality of code may be below expectations, but the main goal of the project was research and producing a conclusions paper for our professor (in Polish, hence not included).

## How to run

```bash
python perceptron/main.py classification sigmoid --test_filename perceptron/projekt1/classification/data.simple.test.100.csv --train_filename perceptron/projekt1/classification/data.simple.train.100.csv --create_nn 3
```
